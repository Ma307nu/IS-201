    <h2>My Favorite Goal</h2>
    <p class="large-font">Lionel Messi's free-kick goal against Liverpool in the 2019 Champions League semi-final is truly one of the most unforgettable moments in football history. What makes this goal so special to me is not just its beauty, but also the context in which it happened. At the 82nd minute, with the pressure building, Messi stood over the ball 30 yards away from goal, and in that moment, time seemed to stand still. His composure and precision were extraordinary. The way he curled the ball over the wall, past Alisson, and into the top corner was a pure display of mastery and technique. The roar of the Camp Nou crowd and the stunned expressions of Liverpool players captured just how incredible the strike was.</p>
