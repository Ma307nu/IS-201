        <p class="large-font" style="margin-left: -30px;"> I played my first tournament when I was 14, and it was an unforgettable experience. The tournament lasted six matches, and although we faced tough competition, my team managed to perform well and reached the semi-finals. In the end, we finished in fourth place, which was still a great accomplishment for us. Throughout the tournament, I scored three goals —one of them being a crucial equalizer in the group stage that helped us advance to the knockout rounds. The games were challenging, but they taught me a lot about teamwork, perseverance, and the joy of playing soccer. Even though we didn’t win a trophy, the memories and lessons from that tournament remain some of my favorites in my soccer journey.</p>

        <p class="large-font" style="margin-left: -30px;"> I played this tournament with my mission friends, and it turned out to be an incredible experience. We performed exceptionally well during the group stage, winning all our matches and building a lot of confidence as a team. I even scored a goal, which made the experience even more memorable. However, in the first game of the playoffs, we faced a tough opponent and ended up losing 6-5 in a close and intense match. Despite the result, I truly believe we deserved to win because we played better and gave everything on the field. Even though we didn't advance further, it was a beautiful experience—one that brought back the joy of playing soccer with good friends and left me with unforgettable memories.</p>
