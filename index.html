    <h2>Soccer</h2>
    <p class="large-font"> Since I was born in Argentina, I have always loved to play and to watch soccer. My favorite club is Boca Juniors, one of the greatest clubs in the world, known for its passionate fans and rich history filled with important titles and legendary players. Alongside Boca Juniors, I have always followed the Argentina national team, supporting them in every tournament and celebrating their successes. I started playing soccer as a child and practiced a lot throughout my school years, training hard and playing in school tournaments. I continued playing regularly until I was 16, when I eventually stopped, but my passion for the sport never faded. Even though I no longer play as often, I still watch every Boca Juniors game and all of Argentina's matches, living every goal and victory as if I were on the field myself. Soccer has always been a part of my life and continues to be a big part of who I am.</p>
